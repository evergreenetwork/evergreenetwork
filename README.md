- 👋 Hi, I’m @evergreenetwork
- 👀 I’m interested in communally nurturing a green and sustainably inclusive circle, in a virtual and physical biosphere.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop a multilateral digital platform @www.greenspace.world to host array of green sustainable solutions, poised at easing connectivity and access - attuned for climate wellness. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to develop a block chain - evergreen.network, a crypto currency - leaflet.tk, complete the design and coding of www.greenspace.world 's app, and geographically mobilize - to setup and run a recourse and support centre in Ghana - and rollout a maiden project; @www.greentent.space - a production to setup green houses - for evaluation for viable production.
- 📫 How to reach me is through email: evergreenetwork@gmail.com or through the project news publication www.evergreen.today to keep up with project update.
